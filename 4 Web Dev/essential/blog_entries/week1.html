<h1> Week 1 - HTML and CSS </h1>
<p>  In this week, I learnt some basics in the web development. HTML has evolved a lot since its first version. 
     HTML 5 is very powerful and with the combination of HTML and CSS3, you can make a website that can look as good as
     flash website. So, I experimented on HTML forms, embedding images, webpage backgrounds, text formatting,text effects,
     and Responsive design. <br />  <br />
