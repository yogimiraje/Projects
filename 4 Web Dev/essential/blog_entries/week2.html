<h1> Week 2 - CSS and Bootstrap </h1>
<p>  This week I performed an experiment with CSS and explored some boostrap classes.Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and
     JS framework for developing responsive web pages.
     You may apply "mobile first" notion to any of your webpage using bootstrap. So I have tried to make all my boostrap 
     experiments responsive. With the power of bootstrap, you can create great webpages with minimal CSS. I explored a few 
     bootstrap classes this week such as navbar, table, form-group, jumbotran, btn etc.
