<h1> Week 3 - JavaScript and jQuery </h1>
<p>  This week I performed some experiments on JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI.
     Mostly I have tried to cover basic features in these technologies.
     These technologies allows you to program the HTML elements and 
     make the changes as per user intraction. This makes the webpage dynamic, user-interactive
     on the client side itself. Check my experiments to know more !.
