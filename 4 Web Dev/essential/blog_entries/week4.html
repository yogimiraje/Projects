<h1> Week 4 - JavaScript and jQuery </h1>
<p>  This week I performed two experiments on web API and three experiments on Angular JS.
      Web API allows you to retrieve the data you want. This obviates need of storing data that you can get from
    some web API  into your local database. I learned how to retrieve a JSONP object from using AJAX and parse it to 
    render into HTML content. In Angular JS experiments, I learnt how the updating of HTML content becomes very easy
     using in-built Angular JS libraries. 
     I leaned about three directives mainly :
     
      The ng-app directive that defines an AngularJS application.
      The ng-model directive that binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
      The ng-bind directive that binds application data to the HTML view.

    This directives help to makes a strong connection between the browser back-end (control) and front-end (view), 
    providing HTML content updates automatically.
