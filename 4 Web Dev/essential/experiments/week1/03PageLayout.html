        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h2> About this experiment</h2>
    <p>  This experiment demostrates simple HTML page layout. This page uses HTML and CSS. No inline CSS is used here. All CSS are defined in separate file for reusability. 
    In these experiments, I have tried to design a simple layout of a webpage. At the top there is header. On left
    hand side, navigation links are present. The main contents of the page are at the center. The footer contents are bottom</p>
    <p> This is achieved by using div in HTML and then mapping each div in css for formatting. Each div is identified with an id. </p>
