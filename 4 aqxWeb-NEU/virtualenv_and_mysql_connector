Having trouble building because of mysql-connector-python? Try this.

Make sure requirements.txt is in aqxWeb-NEU (like next to setup.py, aqxWeb directory, etc.)
edit requirements.txt and REMOVE the line mysql-connector-python==2.1.3

Now you should be good to install all the other libraries.

Go into .../aqxWeb-NEU/
If you haven't yet built a virtualenv, do this...

(aqxWeb-venv)$ virtualenv aqxWeb-venv
(aqxWeb-venv)$ source ./aqxWeb-venv/bin/activate
(aqxWeb-venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now exit your venv or just open a new command line...
To exit a venv just type...

(aqxWeb-venv)$ deactivate

Anyways, go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=458966 and download the tarball (tar.gz file)
Go back to your virtualenv and activate it. Then do

(aqxWeb-venv)$ pip install /path/to/Downloads/mysql-connector-python-2.1.3.tar.gz --egg

Confirm the install

(aqxWeb-venv)$ pip freeze
