/**
 * 	Demonstration of how to retrieve more than 100 tweets using the Twitter API.
 *
 * 	It is based upon the Application Authentication example, and therefore uses application
 * 	authentication.  It does not matter that much which type of authentication you use, although
 * 	it will effect your rate limits.
 *
 * 	You will note that this code has only the bare minimum of error handling.  A real production application
 * 	would have a lot more code in it to catch, diagnose, and recover from errors at all points of interaction
 * 	with Twitter.

		//	This variable is the key to our retrieving multiple blocks of tweets.  In each batch of tweets we retrieve,

		//	sequential over time.  Without setting the MaxId in the query, Twitter will always retrieve the most
		//	recent tweets.  Thus, to retrieve a second (or third or ...) batch of Tweets, we need to set the Max Id

			//	the API when you're not allowed you will eventually get shut down.
			//
			//	Thus, the proper thing to do is always check your limits BEFORE making a call, and if you have
			//	hit your limits sleeping until you are allowed to make calls again.
			//
			//	Every time you call the Twitter API, it tells you how many calls you have left, so you don't have
